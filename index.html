              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
              and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
              the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created
              in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
              hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
              that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
              prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
              and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
              irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
              ocean.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
              Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes
              at the South
              Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
              detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the
              signature of a universe
              being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
              second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
              colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
              whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
              of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
              and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
              its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
              architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
              reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
              would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
              said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
              gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
              space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
              the sun.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
              Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
              here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

          <div class="story-body-container">
            <p class="p-story">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
            <p class="p-story">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a
              definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>

            <p class="p-story">“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
            <p class="p-story">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations
              and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
              select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is
              his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
            <p class="p-story">“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr.
              Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
            <p class="p-story">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular
              variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean
              last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a href="#">knocked on
                his door with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him the news.</p>
