              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
              and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
              the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created
              in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
              hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
              that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
              prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
              and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
              irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
              ocean.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
              Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes
              at the South
              Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
              detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the
              signature of a universe
              being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
              second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
              colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
              whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
              of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
              and space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
              its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
              architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
              reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
              would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
              said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
              gravitational waves.”
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
              space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
              the sun.
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">
              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
              Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
              here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
                <p class="small">Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.</p>

                        <div class="top-4 ">
                            <p><span class="bold">COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>

                            <p><span class="bold">STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="bottom-2 ">
                            <p><span class="bold">INFLATION</span> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p><span class="bold">LUCTUATION</span> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p><span class="bold">EXPANSION</span> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

          <p class="p-story">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,

            <p class="p-story">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from
              inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
              twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
              polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
            <p class="p-story">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the
              temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
              thermometer.</p>
            <p class="p-story">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
            <p class="p-story">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up
              time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
              beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
            <p class="p-story">
              <strong>A Special Time</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="p-story">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying
              up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
              universe.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="story-body-column">
          <div class="story-body-container">
            <p class="p-story">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism,
              and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different
              manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
            <p class="p-story">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some
              old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one
              force after another splitting away.</p>
            <p class="p-story">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
            <p class="p-story">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below
              32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
            <p class="p-story">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that
              case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
            <p class="p-story">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity,
              and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
              space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
            <p class="p-story">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
              trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than
              a cosmic eye-blink.</p>
            <p class="p-story">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
              radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch
              of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free
              lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="story-body-column">
          <div class="story-body-container">
            <p class="p-story">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s
              original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to
              a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles
              endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
            <p class="p-story">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about
              going any deeper into the past.</p>
            <p class="p-story">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because
              inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
              swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
            <p class="p-story">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who
              was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
